## Intro ##
PennyScythe.py is a Python3 script that ingests and runs adversarial emulation plans from SCYTHE's Community Threats Repository: https://github.com/scythe-io/community-threats
 
The script has only been tested with the EvilCorp WastedLocker threat plan, and would likely require enhancements to work with other plans

## Usage ##
```
Usage: PennyScythe.py
```
